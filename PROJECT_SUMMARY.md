## Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture
```
Django Project: recruit_tracker
App: applications

Models:
├── Position (company, title, status, JD, links, dates)
├── ProcessNote (position FK, type, title, content)
└── InterviewEvent (position FK, type, datetime, location)

ViewSets:
├── PositionViewSet (CRUD + fetch_jd action)
├── ProcessNoteViewSet (CRUD with position filtering)
└── InterviewEventViewSet (CRUD with date range filtering)

Serializers:
├── PositionSerializer (full details with nested notes/events)
├── PositionListSerializer (lightweight for lists)
├── ProcessNoteSerializer
└── InterviewEventSerializer
```

### Frontend Architecture
```
React App with React Router

Pages:
├── Dashboard.jsx (stats, recent positions, upcoming events)
├── PositionList.jsx (grid view, add form)
├── PositionDetail.jsx (full details, notes, events, JD)
└── CalendarView.jsx (Big Calendar integration)

Services:
└── api.js (Axios client with all API methods)

Routing:
├── / → Dashboard
├── /positions → PositionList
├── /positions/:id → PositionDetail
└── /calendar → CalendarView
```

### Status Flow
```
Applied → Screening → Coding Test → Technical Interview →
Cultural Fit → Final Interview → Offer → Accepted/Declined

Alternative paths:
- Any stage → Rejected
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Start Backend**: `cd backend && source venv/bin/activate && python manage.py runserver`
2. **Start Frontend**: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. **Access App**: Open http://localhost:5173
4. **Quick Start**: Run `./start.sh` (Mac/Linux)

## Current State

✅ **Complete MVP** - All requested features implemented
✅ **Fully Functional** - Backend and frontend integrated
✅ **Documentation** - Comprehensive docs and examples
✅ **Ready for Prototype** - Can be used immediately

## Next Steps (Based on Figma Design)

1. Review Figma design specifications
2. Compare current UI with design mockups
3. Identify visual/UX differences
4. Update styling to match Figma
5. Refine component layouts and spacing
6. Adjust color scheme if needed
7. Update typography and fonts

## Notes

- This is an MVP designed for rapid prototyping
- Database uses SQLite (upgrade to PostgreSQL for production)
- No authentication implemented (single-user for now)
- Auto JD fetching works best with standard job boards
- All CRUD operations are functional
- Calendar view supports month/week/day perspectives
- Status badges are color-coded for quick visual reference

**Project Status**: ✅ MVP Complete, Ready for Design Refinement
